# HUSKYLENS-FUNCTIONS

seven functions of the HuskyLens, along with their definitions and usage:

Face Recognition:
Definition: This function enables the HuskyLens to identify and recognize faces. It processes facial features to match known individuals.
Usage: Used for security and personalization applications, such as unlocking devices or identifying people in various settings.








Object Detection:
Definition: This function allows HuskyLens to detect and classify objects within its field of view.
Usage: Utilized in robotics and automation to identify and track objects, which can be applied in sorting, quality control, and navigation tasks.











Line Tracking:
Definition: This function enables the HuskyLens to follow a line or path on the ground, often used in line-following robots.
Usage: Applied in autonomous vehicles or robots to maintain a specific course or path, enhancing navigation and automation capabilities.









Color Recognition:
Definition: This function allows the HuskyLens to detect and recognize different colors within its visual range.
Usage: Used in applications requiring color sorting, color-based object detection, or interactive educational tools.










QRCode Recognition:
Definition: This function enables the HuskyLens to scan and interpret QR codes, extracting the encoded information.
Usage: Applied in inventory management, access control, or information retrieval tasks where QR codes are used for quick data access.







Gesture Recognition:
Definition: This function allows the HuskyLens to identify and interpret specific hand gestures or movements.
Usage: Useful in interactive systems and control interfaces, where gestures can be used to command devices or navigate menus.





Tag Tracking:
Definition: This function enables the HuskyLens to detect and track specific visual tags or markers within its view.
Usage: Applied in augmented reality (AR), robotics, and object tracking systems to identify and follow specific markers or tags.












Each of these functions provides distinct capabilities that can be leveraged in various applications to enhance automation.
