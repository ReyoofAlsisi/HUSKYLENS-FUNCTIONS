# HUSKYLENS-FUNCTIONS

seven functions of the HuskyLens, along with their definitions and usage:

Face Recognition:
Definition: This function enables the HuskyLens to identify and recognize faces. It processes facial features to match known individuals.
Usage: Used for security and personalization applications, such as unlocking devices or identifying people in various settings.


Line Tracking:
Definition: This function enables the HuskyLens to follow a line or path on the ground, often used in line-following robots.
Usage: Applied in autonomous vehicles or robots to maintain a specific course or path, enhancing navigation and automation capabilities.




Color Recognition:
Definition: This function allows the HuskyLens to detect and recognize different colors within its visual range.
Usage: Used in applications requiring color sorting, color-based object detection, or interactive educational tools.




Object Recognition:
Definition: Identifies and distinguishes objects in an image based on pre-trained models.
Usage: Use this function to detect and identify objects in a visual scene. For example, you might use it to recognize specific types of objects, such as cars or animals, in a live video feed.




Object Tracking:
Definition: Monitors and follows the movement of a specific object over time across consecutive frames.
Usage: Apply this function to track an object’s position and movement. For instance, you can use it to follow a moving ball in a sports game or a person walking in a security camera feed.




Object Classification:
Definition: Categorizes detected objects into predefined classes or categories.
Usage: Utilize this function to sort objects into categories, such as distinguishing between types of fruits or animals. It’s helpful for applications where you need to categorize and count different objects in a scene.






Tag Tracking:
Definition: This function enables the HuskyLens to detect and track specific visual tags or markers within its view.
Usage: Applied in augmented reality (AR), robotics, and object tracking systems to identify and follow specific markers or tags.












Each of these functions provides distinct capabilities that can be leveraged in various applications to enhance automation.
